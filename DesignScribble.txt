Daily Notes:


- When should players be allowed to cull cards during the Roundtable phase?
    [ Waiting, BeingPicked ]

- What If?
    Not showing CullHints during the Roundtable phase for new possible CardPairs in Deck?
        => Keep player engaged throughout the gameplay.
        => 'Punish' player for not having attention,
            since other player can take away one of the Cards from the CardPair.
