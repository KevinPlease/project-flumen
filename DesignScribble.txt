Milestone #2 -> Single Player mode
    
    - Special 'AI' class* to do "auto" card logic:
        - Should create x AIs in the beginning of GM SP

        - culling
            + Find next available card pair and cull (loop over all cards)
            + Should call respective Dispatcher and let parent (GM) know of Culling Attempt
        - picking
            - On Next Turn, if the active player is not 0 and its the Picking phase,
                call AI to auto-pick card from the nextPlayerIndex
                + Pass to AI method the card size of nextPlayerIndex deck and
                    return a random int within that range.
                + Call GM: EventPlayerPickedCard with the index
        - shuffling
            ...

*class (O_AI) - to be as similar to a PC as possible
    - bind events from the GS, the same way PC does
    - make use of Dispatchers to call GM/GS methods in a similar PC way

    Events from PC:
    1) Event Connected
    2)
