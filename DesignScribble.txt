Issue #106 - Card Deck positioning on screen

    Currently -- The GameBoard handles position shifts for the CardDeck:
        Each card addition/removal shifts the relative offset of the entire CardDeck.
			ISSUE: Because on card added/removed should shift the Deck DEPENDING if the card index
				is left or right of the 'center' index of the Deck.
		1- Handled by the GameBoard.
			Move logic within the CardDeck itself?
		2- The shift offset is hardcoded as a Config value in the BP_GameBoard.
			Research for a more dynamic approach - use of Card offset variable?
		

	New -- The CardDeck will be responsible of keeping the Cards in the center of itself.
		- Q: How to find the center coordinate of the CardDeck from the amount of cards?
			- CardDeck spawns card using an offset for each, depending on index.
				=> offset x CEIL(card length / 2) = relative coordinate for the center of deck
		
		1- Remove the dispatcher events GameBoard <-> CardDeck.
			- On card added/removed -> directly call the shift logic*.
		2- Use the card distance offset (both available in CardDeck and the Card itself) 
		*Shift Logic:
			- Should calculate the CardDeck's center offset on card added/removed
				AND set the relative location of the CardHolder.
					(should always be on the X axis and negated)
