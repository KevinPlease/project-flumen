Daily Notes:

Card Repositioning System:
    - Cards will have a Collision box in the middle (look @Sketches)
    - OnCollision with another Card => notify the owner Deck that a request to switch positions is made
    - Deck switches the card actor positions with each other -- updates new indices for all Cards after
        new attachments are made.
    - CHECK: Notify GM of the changes in card indices -> GM updates the CardMaster for the specific Player Deck.

@CardDeck - Card Pos Changes (i.e: Move subject Card from pos x to position Y where a target Card is)
    1- ASSUME: subject Card is currently PickedUp, moved to the respective target Card's collision and
        the repositioning is confirmed (eg: clicking/touching again)
    2- Store the curLocation of the target Card so we move the subject Card later.
    3- Call BP_Deck to shift(Animate*) the target Card (along with the children) along the horizontal axis, to make
        room for the new subject Card.
    4- Animate* the subject Card into the stored location in step 2.
    3- Call the UpdateCardActorPosition for both Cards:
        - Target will be attached to the subject Card.
        - Subject card will be attached to the Card on its' left.
    4- BP_Deck should update its O_Deck reference.
    5- Notify the GM of the updated card indices...

*Animate: This is related with the next Issue, #18 so don't focus now.
